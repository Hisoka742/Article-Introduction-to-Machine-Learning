## What is Machine Learning?
Arthur Samuel defined Machine Learning as:
> "The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

Machine Learning enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance. For example, Samuel's checkers-playing program in the 1950s became better than its creator by playing thousands of games against itself.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning refers to training a model using labeled data (input `x` and output `y`). This approach dominates modern applications of Machine Learning.

### Examples:
1. **Spam Detection**: Classify emails as spam or not spam.
2. **Speech Recognition**: Convert audio clips into text.
3. **Ad Recommendation**: Predict user interaction with online ads.

### Key Types:
#### Regression:
Used to predict continuous numerical values, such as housing prices based on square footage.

#### Classification:
Used to predict discrete categories, such as identifying a tumor as benign or malignant.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning involves analyzing data without labeled outputs. It aims to find patterns or structures in the dataset.

### Key Types:
1. **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points (e.g., categorizing news articles by topic).
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual events, like fraudulent transactions.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Compressing datasets while retaining essential information.

## Tools: Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is a popular tool for Machine Learning practitioners. It supports:
- **Markdown cells**: For documentation and explanations.
- **Code cells**: For executing Python code.

## Linear Regression

Linear Regression predicts values using a straight-line relationship between inputs and outputs. For example:
- **Input**: House size (square feet).
- **Output**: House price.

The model fits a line (`y = wx + b`) to the data, where:
- `w`: Slope of the line.
- `b`: Intercept of the line.

### Why Linear Regression?
- Itâ€™s simple and interpretable.
- Forms the basis for more advanced models.
